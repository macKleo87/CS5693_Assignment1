Information about our project
- The staircase is simple but took us 40 minutes because we are not familiar with 3D modeling and had to try many different tools before finding something that worked. We also modeled the dome on the roof.
- We've spent about 2 hours trying to get the xbox controller working on our macs and have had no luck. But we followed the provided tutorials and hopefully correctly implemented xbox controls without being able to test it. We were able to test the "A" button working earlier in the week just not the start and movement. We tried to solve this by going to the designated lab in the library to test with an xbox controller and we found out it doesn't have the right version of Unity and in order to download it we needed an admin password which the library would not help us with. 
- We have not been able to test it with a VR headset but we did follow instructions for the OVR Controller so it should work as expected.
- The window in part 2 is from a free asset package from the asset store that we thought was cool.
